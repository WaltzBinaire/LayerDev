## WELCOME TO <MEISTERSTÜCKE>
### URBAN ART MEETS A.I.

For this project, the Instagram accounts of 12 Urban Artists were used as a database.

Each artist was finally portrayed through their own art through Artificial Intelligence.

_<MEISTERSTÜCKE> was initiated and enabled by Jägermeister._

By making this code Open Source, we hope we can inspire makers everywhere to create new, exciting projects of their own.

In other words: Do what’s never been done so people can feel what’s never been felt. Be the Meister.
